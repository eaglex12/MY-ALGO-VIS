# Algorithm Visualization Platform

This is a React-based website designed to serve as a visualization platform for various searching, sorting, and scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive and educational experience for users to learn and understand different algorithms through visualizations.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar:** Easy access to different sections of the website.
- **Algorithm Boxes:** Visual representations of each algorithm with images and descriptions.
- **Live Clock:** Displays the current time on the website.
- **Smooth Scrolling:** Smooth navigation to anchor elements when specific links are clicked.
- **Footer:** Additional site information and links.
